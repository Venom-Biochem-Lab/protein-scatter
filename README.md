# protein-map

Like a map of the land of proteins used to model close similarity and explore neighbors

## TODO

- [x] read from pdb file 3D center location of each amino acid (as $\alpha$ carbon for now)
- [x] extract features relevant to the 3D info
- [ ] Train sequence model on the new alphabet
- [ ] extract embeddings and visualize in 2D
- [ ] Train sequence model on the entire PDB
- [ ] extract embeddings and visualize in 2D
- [ ] create interface around it
