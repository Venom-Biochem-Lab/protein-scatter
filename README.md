# protein-map

Like a map of the land of proteins used to model close similarity and explore neighbors

## TODO

- [ ] Convert a given `.pdb` file into a 3Di sequence
- [ ] If that doesn't work, at least extract the same info and can learn relationship through model (check if otherwise)
- [ ] Train sequence model on the venome
- [ ] extract embeddings and visualize in 2D
- [ ] Train sequence model on the entire PDB
- [ ] extract embeddings and visualize in 2D
- [ ] create interface around it
