# protein-scatter

A map of proteins for exploration and discovery. Specifically to explore many local parts of proteins all at once.

This code uses [Foldseek](https://github.com/steineggerlab/foldseek)'s 3Di representation instead of amino acids to train a sequence model. The embeddings from the sequence model are then fed into UMAP for a global visualization.

What makes this system different? Here I explicitly model each protein as the interactions of it's internal 3D structure. I then compare across many different proteins for a global visualization.

## Models and Datasets

If you want to reproduce these results check the training code in the [`training/`](./training/) directory.

Note that UMAP transformation was does in python notebooks not in the python code.

The weights are saved in `checkpoint-large-3.pt` in this [ Google Drive ](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FerixS81_qof0QD-k-0PN3kUSt8oBWLK?usp=sharing) as well as additional training data.
