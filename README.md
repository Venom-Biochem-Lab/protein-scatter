# protein-scatter

A map of proteins for exploration and discovery. Specifically to explore many local parts of proteins all at once. 

This code uses [Foldseek](https://github.com/steineggerlab/foldseek)'s 3Di representation instead of amino acids to train a sequence model. The embeddings from the sequence model are then fed into UMAP for a global visualization.

What makes this system different? Here I explicitly model each protein as the interactions of it's internal 3D structure. I then compare across many different proteins for a global visualization.
